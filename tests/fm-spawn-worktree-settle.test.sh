# Regression test for the fm-spawn.sh treehouse-get worktree-detection settle
# loop (bin/fm-spawn.sh, the FM_TREEHOUSE_GET_TIMEOUT wait after `treehouse get`).
#
# On some tmux/WSL setups a brand-new window's pane_current_path transiently
# reports a stale, unrelated-but-real path on the very first poll, before the
# pane actually settles into the worktree treehouse get moved it to. That stale
# path still passes the loop's "differs from the project" check and
# validate_spawn_worktree's "is a real, distinct worktree" check (it IS a real
# git checkout, just the wrong one), so a naive single-read loop silently
# records the wrong worktree= in state/<id>.meta. This test simulates that
# transient-then-settled pane_current_path sequence with a fake tmux and
# asserts the recorded worktree resolves to the real, settled worktree, never
# the stale first read.
#
# The same loop has a second transient to survive: `treehouse get` reports the
# REPOSITORY's primary checkout as its own cwd while it is still preparing a
# slot. From a linked spawning home that path is not the project, so a poll
# comparing only against the project adopted it and the isolation guard then
# refused the launch. The cases below cover both the transient and the pane
# that never leaves the primary at all.
#
# The wait is wall-clock rather than a fixed count of polls, because a loaded
# machine can take minutes to prepare a slot. The last cases pin that: a pane
# that settles only after more polls than the old fixed bound still launches,
# and a malformed FM_TREEHOUSE_GET_TIMEOUT refuses before any window opens.
